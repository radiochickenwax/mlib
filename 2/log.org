** log for folder 2
*** Sat Aug 29, 2015 14:17:19 having a folder named 2 is stupid.

    What I need to do here is use what's here to make something useful.  

    There are 2 useful things here.  A calculator is useful, but it's
    not as useful as the dynamic array which could be made into a
    library that can be built on.  

    So what I want to do is build dynamicArray.c into dynamicArray.so
    with gcc in the makefile.  Then build testDynArray.c and calc.c
    by linking to the .so file.  


    # add instructions and links to building shared / static libraries
    # with gcc here.

    Static libs are created with ar.

    Shared libs are created with 
    
    gcc -c -fPIC
    gcc -shared -Wl, -soname,

    Eventually, I'm going to want to benchmark this stuff.  Where do I
    have benchmarking routines?
