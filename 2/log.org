** log for folder 2
*** Sat Aug 29, 2015 14:17:19 having a folder named 2 is stupid.

    What I need to do here is use what's here to make something useful.  

    There are 2 useful things here.  A calculator is useful, but it's
    not as useful as the dynamic array which could be made into a
    library that can be built on.
