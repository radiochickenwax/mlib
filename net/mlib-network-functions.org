**** Mon Aug 31, 2015 14:00:38 what to do.
     There's not really a whole lot here to start with.  

     On another hand, there's really quite a bit.   Let's start with
     the python server/clients.

**** Wed Sep 16, 2015 10:06:01 finally getting back to this.
     Running into problems trying to add tcpUdpChat as a submodule.
     This is from a different project at
     https://github.com/mitchgre/tcpUdpChat.  

     I'd really like to keep that project isolated.  The easiest
     thing to do is just copy the source files and delete the git
     trackers.  So I guess that's what I'm going to do now rather
     than deal with submodules.
